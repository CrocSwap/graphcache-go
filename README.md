# graphcache-go

Provides simple and fast endpoints to index the CrocSwap protocol on Ethereum based networks.

## Quickstart

To compile, from the project root directory call

`go build`

After building to run, from the project root directory call

`./graphcache-go`

## Network options

By default the instance uses the network config at `./config/networks.json`. To use a different configuration file run with

`./graphcache-go -netCfg [NETWORK_CONFIG_PATH]`

The RPC endpoint can be overriden in the environment by setting the `RPC_MAINNET` env variable before running:

    export RPC_MAINNET=[RPC_URL] 
    ./graphcache-go
